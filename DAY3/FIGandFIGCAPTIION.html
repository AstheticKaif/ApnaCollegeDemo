        Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub[a] (c. 1137 – 4 March 1193), commonly known
        as Saladin,[b] was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Hailing from a
        Kurdish family, he was the first sultan of both Egypt and Syria. An
        important figure of the Third Crusade, he spearheaded the Muslim
        military effort against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height
        of his power, the Ayyubid realm spanned Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia,
        the Hejaz, Yemen, and Nubia. Alongside his uncle Shirkuh, a Kurdish
        Mercenary commander in service of the Zengid dynasty,[6] Saladin was
        sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164, on the orders of the Zengid ruler Nur
        ad-Din. With their original purpose being to help restore Shawar as the
        vizier to the teenage Fatimid caliph al-Adid, a power struggle ensued
        between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated. Saladin,
        meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his
        military successes against Crusader assaults as well as his personal
        closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh died in
        1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin as vizier. During his tenure, Saladin, a
        Sunni Muslim, began to undermine the Fatimid establishment; following
        al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the Cairo-based Isma'ili Shia
        Muslim Fatimid Caliphate and realigned Egypt with the Baghdad-based
        Sunni Abbasid Caliphate.
